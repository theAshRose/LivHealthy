## About

This is an app for guidance on living healthy(or, LivHealthy). Here is a place for any individual to visit - searching for detailed recipes and exercises to fit their lifestyle needs and capacity while guided by inspirational, motivating quotes.

## Why?

Since Covid-19 our world has been more isolated than ever. Isolation can lead to unhealthy habits, ways of thinking and lower quality of life as such. LivHealthy seeks to mitigate the negative health effects of isolation and lack of direction. If you cant make up your mind as to whats for dinner - dont order out: LivHealthy.

## How to use

Simply nagivate to the "Recipes" tab to search for a tasty recipe based on something as simple as a keyword(salad, cake, pizza, potatoe, etc) and/or a specific dietary need such as dairy, gluten, vegan, vegetarian, nut allergy, etc. - one may even specify by amount of nutrients per serving with carbs, protein etc.. Once the user entered their
requested parameters a list of recipes appear. Livhealthy dynamically generates a list of recipes with a, title, nutrients and a link to detailed instructions on how to cook it.

A user may hit the "save" button attatched to a recipe, that recipe is saved into their local storage within a specific array and then saved into its own unique slot - which gets written into a button on their "home" page(click "home" to view home page). The user may return home to revisit their saved recipes and exercises, view their nutrition facts or instructions and have the option to delete their item. If the user deletes a recipe or exercise their button associated with it dissapears until they search and select it again.

Just as one navigates recipes they navigate exercises, simple as that. Albeit short of nutrient values, exercises function in the same way as recipes - except they cant be eaten.

That gets us to our next point; Chart.js:
Below in the Code you will see our explaination of chart.js as well as a code snippet, but lets talk about how it interacted with our saved recipes: we didnt pull recipe data from the web to populate and save chart.js - we pulled it from the saved recipes of the users themselves. That make a fun juggle of information using localstorage and the user for us developers of LivHealthy.

## The Code

The most challenging part of LivHealthy for the team was learning and implimenting new technology on the fly.
Below is an prime example of that: Chart.js implementation. We not only managed to sucessfully impliment Chart.js according
to project goals, but managed to add functionality above and beyond what was required. This, we are proud of, so enjoy our code snippet of Chart.js updating AND saving data for the user - while allowing user input only to clear said data.

```
        $("#homeNutrients").on("click", "#eat-me", function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        updateChartData(event);
});

    console.log($("#homeHealthScore"));
    const myChart = new Chart(document.getElementById("myChart"), config);

    updateChartData() {
        let storedChart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("storedChart")) || [0 ,0, 0, 0, 0, 0];

        let calories = storedChart[0];
        let fat = storedChart[1];
        saturatedFat = storedChart[2];
        let carbohydrates = storedChart[3];
        let sugar = storedChart[4];
        let protein = storedChart[5];

    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[0] = calories += parseInt(
        $("#homeCaloriesLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[1] = fat += parseInt(
        $("#homeFatLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[2] = saturatedFat += parseInt(
        $("#homeSatFatLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[3] = carbohydrates += parseInt(
        $("#homeCarbsLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[4] = sugar += parseInt(
        $("#homeSugarLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[6] = protein += parseInt(
        $("#homeProteinLi").text()
    );

    storedChart = myChart.data.datasets[0].data
    localStorage.setItem("storedChart", JSON.stringify(storedChart))
    myChart.update();
}

    $(document).ready(function () {
        let storedChart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("storedChart")) || [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
        myChart.data.datasets[0].data = storedChart;
        myChart.update();
    })

    $("#delete-me-chart").on("click", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    let storedChart = [0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0]
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data = storedChart
    localStorage.removeItem("storedChart")
    myChart.update()
})
```
